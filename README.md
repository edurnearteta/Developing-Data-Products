## About Application

This Application can be used to calculate the Body Mass Index, which is a measure of relative weight based on an individual's mass and height.

1. Application to study the measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.The BMI is used in a wide variety of contexts as a simple method to assess how much an individual's body weight departs from what is normal or desirable for a person of his or her height.
2. Two Sections of Application
    - Sidebar Panel : Make you input two variables: individual's weight and height 
    - Main Panel : BMI and the ranges of BMI values conforming categories are shown.            
                   Also a barplot with BMI and weight.

## What is BMI

Essentially, BMI is a simple mathematical formula, based on height and weight, that is used to measure fatness.
To calculate your BMI, divide your weight by your height  squared.

## How to use Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator

Link of Application on github shiny server : https://earteta.shinyapps.io/DDPProject/
1. Enter the value of the height (in meters)
2. Enter the value of the weight (in kilograms)
3. Press "Compute BMI" and your BMI will be calculated and displayed. Also the BMI category you belong to will be shown.


## Result interpretation

Underweight     < 18.5
Normal weight	  18.5 - 24.9
Overweight  	  25.0 - 29.9
Obesity        	â‰¥ 30.0

## Accuracy of the BMI

It's important to note that although BMI is accurate most of the time, it may overestimate or underestimate body fat. For example, BMI doesn't distinguish between body fat and muscle mass, which weighs more than fat. Many NFL players have been labeled "obese" because of their high BMI, when they actually have a low percentage of body fat. 

The BMI is not always accurate in elderly adults, who have often lost muscle and bone mass. Although their BMI might be within a normal range, they could still be
overweight. BMI may also relate differently to various ethnic groups. For example, Asians may be at risk for health problems at a lower BMI than Caucasians.

Because of the possibility for error, BMI should be just one of many gauges used to assess a person's weight status and healt
